# montyhall

instructions: 
  run: npm install
   - I added some terminal interfacing not necessary for completion of problem
 
  trials.js includes terminal enhancements and commented code
    - to see terminal progress bar actually calculate change amount of simulations to 10,000,000

  trials_raw.js is an uncommented version without any of the added terminal enhancements

  both '.js' files will print and overwrite results.txt
